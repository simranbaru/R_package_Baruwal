```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation

Load in common library 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

```

You need to install some fbd R package for this package in run.
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("FossilSim")
library(FossilSim)
```

Now, we install my R package:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("simranbaru/R_Package_Baruwal")
```

Let us download some data for our package:

```{r}
```

## Working Example

+ An example of each function and how it works 
+ Explain why to use it
+ Say something on expected output

```{r}
result <- simulateddata 
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
